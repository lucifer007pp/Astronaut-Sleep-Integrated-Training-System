## Astronaut Sleep-Integrated Training System ðŸŒŒðŸš€
# Overview
The # Astronaut Sleep-Integrated Training System (ASITS) # is a cutting-edge web-based simulation platform designed to train astronauts during sleep. The system leverages lucid dreaming techniques and subconscious conditioning to rehearse mission scenarios such as emergencies, repairs, landings, and relaxation exercises â€” all in a safe, immersive virtual environment.

This repository features a modern interactive 3D website built with Vite, React, Three.js, and GSAP, providing astronauts and users with an intuitive, space-inspired interface.
